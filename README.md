# ElNinoBackpack
This is a Halloween costume that I threw together in 2015. I made a cloud out of papier-mâché and added lights. 
There are three different light modes: brightness adjust; flash rate; and random to simulate lightning. 

The adjustments to the different modes are done with a potentiometer and mode selection is done with a momentary switch. Video of the backpack can be found in the 'Media' folder.
